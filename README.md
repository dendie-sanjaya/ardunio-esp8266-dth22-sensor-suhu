**esp8266**

ESP8266 is a very popular Wi-Fi module, which allows devices to connect to Wi-Fi networks and communicate over the internet. This module is often used in Internet of Things (IoT) projects because of its small size, affordable price, and ability to run its own code through an integrated microcontroller

**DHT22**

Sensor a temperature and humidity sensor known for its higher accuracy compared to the DHT11 (a simpler version).

This sensor can measure temperature in the range of -40 to +80 °C with an accuracy of around ±0.5°C, and humidity in the range of 0-100% RH with an accuracy of around ±2-5%.
